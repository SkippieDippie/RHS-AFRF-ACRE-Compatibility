# CVO-Everything-Compats

## Note: at the moment I'm unable to put out any regular or big/meaningful updates, don't worry though, I will come back either in the next spring or sooner if I'm lucky.

This mod aims to make certain mods compatible with mods like ACRE, GreenMag and possibly other.

Be aware that this mod was primarily created for the community I'm playing with so the compats will be balanced around this.
